. Here's the summary:

Model	Mean AUC	Std
WITH age_campaign	0.7822	0.0050
WITHOUT age_campaign	0.7807	0.0051
Difference: +0.0015 (+0.19%)

Key Findings
The feature has a marginal positive impact — but only +0.15% improvement in AUC
Inconsistent across folds — In Fold 4, the model actually performed worse with the feature (-0.0005)
Within standard deviation — The improvement (0.0015) is smaller than the standard deviation (0.005), meaning it's likely not statistically significant
Verdict
While technically positive, the age_campaign feature provides negligible value. The improvement is:

Smaller than fold-to-fold variance
Not robust (1 out of 5 folds showed negative impact)
Likely within the margin of noise
For a production model, you could safely remove this feature to reduce complexity without meaningful performance loss.
